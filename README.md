# Steampunk Calendar Orrery Yahoo Widget
 
(TimeKeeper 5.2.7)
 
The Steampunk Calendar Orrery Yahoo Widget, written in Javascript 
and XML for the Yahoo Widget (Konfabulator) Engine. Created for XP, Vista, Win7, 
8, 10+ as well as  Apple Mac Sierra.



This Steampunk Calendar Orrery Yahoo Widget is an attractive steampunk 
Yahoo widget for your desktop. Think of it as a piece of Space 1899 high tech. 
- perhaps the Martian attack has failed and the humans are returning to Mars for 
their revenge? This is a piece of the Victorian space technology that human 
space farers might use in their quest for conquest of Mars.

In reality it is one my Steampunk widgets. You can select a date and enter a 
memorandum for that date, it is fully configurable. An elegant widget - give it 
a go. There is a brand new version under development now and you can see that 
being built here on DeviantArt: yereverluvinuncleber.deviantarâ€¦

It is more than just starting to do something now. The widget now fully controls 
a calendar, the calendar wheel rotates, the day under the display indicates the 
date selected. If a memorandum exists for that day then it can be configured to 
automatically display. The calendar ring rotate by mouse control, the date, day, 
month and year display according to ring position. The inner earth and moon 
rotate, the moon around the earth. The earth rotating around the central glow, 
roughly follows the track of the window circular frame. The inner wheel with 
lots of bolts counter-rotates as the main calendar ring rotates. The widget is 
fully resizable. The right and left hand cogs now rotate.

It was based upon a superb blog navigation device on Ian Tregillis site created 
by Richard Mueller of 3232 design. His superb bit of Adobe Flash was really 
inspirational and it made me want to complete it (the original only shows 50% of 
the device and was limited to running only on web-pages within the browser). My 
version will add functionality and will run on your Mac or Windows desktop. See 
the original here:

These Widgets are moveable widgets that you can move anywhere around the 
desktop as you require.The widgets can be resized - Hover the cursor over the 
widget. Press the CTRL key and use your mousewheel up or down. The widget will 
resize dynamically.

All javascript widgets need an engine to function, in this case the widget uses 
the Yahoo Widget Konfabulator engine. The engine interprets the javascript and 
creates the widget according to the XML description and using the images you 
provide.
