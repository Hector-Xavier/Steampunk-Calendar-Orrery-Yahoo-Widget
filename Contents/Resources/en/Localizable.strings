/*
	Month Calendar: English Localization File
	Written by Harry Whitfield (g6auc@arrl.net)
	Version 3.6.3

	Localization instructions:
	- When localizing, only change the items on the right side of the "equals" signs.
	- There is no need to change things in comments like this one.
	- Make sure to use colons and ellipses where they're used here.
	- Please ensure that the file is saved with UTF-8 encoding.
	- Best viewed at tab size 4.  Do not use soft tabs.
	- Make sure to change the name and email address given above so we can give you
	  credit for your work!  Submissions without this information will not be considered.
	- It's *highly* preferred that you start with the English localization file if you
	  can, as subsequent translations can obscure the intended meaning.

	Variable data information:
	- There are some areas where the grammar may vary from region to region.  For those
	  instances, we've created a specific format for localization.  Anything within
	  double percent signs is a variable that is inserted by the Widget at runtime.
	- Anything within double percent signs must *not* be localized, however you may
	  rearrange or omit items as necessary.  Anything outside double-percent signs may
	  be localized as normal.
	- For said items with double-percent-sign variables in them, we've provided a list
	  of valid variables for you to use.

	That's about it, really.  Let me know if you need any help with localization.
